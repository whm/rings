=head1 NAME

remctl-ring-control - remctl script to control rings daemons

=head1 SYNOPSIS

remctl-ring-control [help|status|restart|start|stop] [daemon|load]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script allows the rings processing and load daemons to be
controlled using remctl.  The script is essentially a wrapper
around systemctl.

The ring-daemon daemon processes pictures generating the picture
resolutions from the input directory.  The processing queue is
maintained in the rings database.

The ring-load daemon examines input pictures and generates queue
entries for the ring-daemon process.

=head1 ARGUMENTS
