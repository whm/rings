# rings

The rings application is a Picture Gallery with the following 
main features.

* When pictures are uploaded to the application the raw pictures
  are stored in several resolutions.  The user is free to pick
  the resolution that provides the best trade off between high
  fidelity to the original picture and download performance.
  
* The application provides for tagging pictures.  These tags 
  can be used as navigation paths through the pictures, i.e. 
  picture rings.
  
* The application provides for levels of visibility of tags.

  - Tags marked 'SHOW' are visible to the world.
  - Tags maarked 'HIDDEN' suppresses the display of the 
    tag.  The picture is still publically visible.
  - Tags Invisible suppresses the display of both the tag
    and any picture with the tag.  Users that have logged 
    in can view all tags and pictures.
    
* The application provides single level groups of tags.
